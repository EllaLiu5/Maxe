In this challenge, you are expected to design and manage your own Hadoop cluster on AWS 
using EC2 instances, not the EMR service. The cluster needs to have two or more nodes. 
The goal is to perform a 500-GB sorting in approximately an hour using the example applications 
that come with the standard Hadoop distribution with both deadline (60 minutes) and budget 
($25 USD) constraints.

Apart from not using the EMR service, you are free to use any technology you are familiar 
with to achieve this goal. You are allowed to use Google search (or any other search engine). 
You are not allowed to seek help from others (including the use of instant messaging) during the 
challenge. 


(1) Design Phase

Describe the design of your cluster in details, including the EC2 instance type and the number 
of nodes. If you use more than one instance type, please describe the purpose of each instance type. 

Describe in details how you arrived in this design. In particular, how can your design meet the 
above-mentioned deadline and budget constraints?


(2) Hadoop Cluster Setup

Launch the EC2 instances needed in your AWS account. Provide id of your instances and the security 
group being used on each instance. If there are anything else that is needed for us to understand 
your cluster, please also describe in details.

~~~~Cluster Information~~~~
#1: [instance id], [security group id], [private ip]
#2: [instance id], [security group id], [private ip]
#3: [instance id], [security group id], [private ip]
~~~~

SSH into these nodes to configure your cluster. On each node, configure your bash history size to 2000.

~~~~Configure Bash History Size~~~~
[the command]
~~~~

Once you are done with configuring your Hadoop cluster, copy and paste the bash command history 
from all nodes.

~~~~Node 1, Bash History~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 2, Bash History~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 3, Bash History~~~~

~~~~

If you make any modifications to the Hadoop configuration on the nodes, please copy and paste the 
part that you add or modify to the configuration files:

~~~~Node 1, Configuration Filename 1~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 1, Configuration Filename 2~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 2, Configuration Filename 1~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 2, Configuration Filename 2~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 3, Configuration Filename 1~~~~

~~~~

~~~~Node 3, Configuration Filename 2~~~~

~~~~

(3) 10-GB Sorting

Perform a 10-GB sorting first to demonstrate that the cluster works. Copy and paste the commands 
and the outputs from TeraGen, TeraSort, and TeraValidate.

~~~~TeraGen Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

~~~~TeraSort Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

~~~~TeraValidate Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

(4) 500-GB Sorting

Perform the 500-GB sorting. Copy and paste the commands and the outputs from TeraGen, TeraSort, 
and TeraValidate.

~~~~TeraGen Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

~~~~TeraSort Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

~~~~TeraValidate Command and Output~~~~

~~~~

While waiting for your 500-GB sorting results, please elaborate any *technical* thoughts that come 
to your mind that is related to this challenge.

~~~Thoughts~~~~

~~~~

How does the test results differ from your designed cost and deadline constraint? What have you learned from this?

~~~~Thoughts~~~~

(5) Terminate Your Cluster

Terminate all the EC2 instances needed for your challenge. If you do not terminate then, you will 
be charged for any expenses to occur. 

(6) Submit Your Results
